> Convert between singular and plural forms of English nouns.

**Strings::Inflect** provides noun conversions to singular and plural form component for [Strings](https://github.com/piotrmurach/strings).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'strings-inflect'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install strings-inflect

* [2. API](#2-api)
  * [2.1 inflect](#21-inflect)

## 1. Usage

**Strings::Inflect** provides `pluralize` to convert a noun to plural form:

```ruby
Strings::Inflect.pluralize("error")
# => "errors"
```

```ruby
Strings::Inflect::Noun["error"].plural
# => "errors"
Strings::Inflect::Verb["is"].plural
# => "are"
```

To inflect a noun to a singular form use `singularize` method:

```ruby
Strings::Inflect.singularize("errors")
# => "error"
```

There is also more generic `inflect` method that accepts a noun and count:

```ruby
Strings::Inflect.inflect("error", 3)
# => "errors"
```

## 2. API

### 2.1 inflect

In the most common case, to change a noun's inflection use `inflect` method with the word and a count. By default `inflect` assumes a noun.

For example, to inflect the noun `error` to its plural form do:

```ruby
Strings::Inflect.inflect("error", 2) # => "errors"
```

And to inflect a verb, use the `:term` option:

```ruby
Strings::Inflect.inflect("tries", 2, term: :verb) # => "try"
```

For more complex cases when you want to inflect parts of a sentence, the `inflect` provides tags in a template.

For example, you can inflect a noun and a verb to display information based on the count:

```ruby
Strings::Inflect.inflect("{{#:count}} {{N:error}} {{V:was}} found", 2)
# => "2 errors were found"
```

#### 2.1.1 template

The template inflects any content inside mustache-like braces `{{...}}`. The general form of content inside tag is `{{Xmod:word}}` where:

* `X` informs a grammatical function to apply to word out of `N` or `V` and `#`.
* `mod` apply zero or more modifiers to word transformation.
* `word` represents the string to inflect.

The available tags are:

`{{#: count }}`

The first type of tag is the count tag. By default, this tag will display the count inside the evaluated string.

```ruby
String::Inflect.inflect("{{#:count}} found", 2)
# => "2 found"
```

There is an `f` option that will provide a fuzzy estimation of the count:

```ruby
String::Inflect.inflect("{{#f:count}}", 0) # => "no"
String::Inflect.inflect("{{#f:count}}", 1) # => "one"
String::Inflect.inflect("{{#f:count}}", 2) # => "a couple of"
String::Inflect.inflect("{{#f:count}}", 3) # => "a few"
String::Inflect.inflect("{{#f:count}}", 6) # => "several"
String::Inflect.inflect("{{#f:count}}", 12) # => "many"
```

`{{N: word }}`

This tag inflects a noun into a singular or plural form based on the provided count.

```ruby
Strings::Inflect.inflect("{{#:count}} {{N:error}} found", 3)
# => "3 errors found"
```

You can supply `s` or `p` options to always force a noun to be singular or plural form.

```ruby
Strings::Inflect.inflect("{{#:count}} {{Ns:error}} found", 3)
# => "3 error found"
```

`{{V: word }}`

This tag inflects a verb into appropriate form based on the provided count.

```ruby
Strings::Inflect.inflect("There {{V:were}} {{#:count}} {{N:match}} found", 1)
# => "There was 1 match found"
```

### 2.2 singularize

You can transform a noun or a verb into singular form with `singularize` method. By default it assumes a noun but you can change this with `:term` option:

```ruby
Strings::Inflect.singularize("errors") # => "error"
Strings::Inflect.singularize("indices") # => "index"
Strings::Inflect.singularize("index", term: :verb) # => "indexes"
Strings::Inflect.singularize("try", term: :verb) # => "tries"
```

It will handle inflecting irregular nouns or verbs as well:

```ruby
Strings::Inflect.singularize("feet") # => "foot"
Strings::Inflect.singularize("are", term: :verb) # => "is"
Strings::Inflect.singularize("go", term: :verb) # => "goes"
```

This method won't change inflection if it already is in the correct form:

```ruby
Strings::Inflect.singularize("index") # => "index"
Strings::Inflect.singularize("sees") # => "sees"
```

### 2.3 pluralize

### 2.4 join_words

To join an array of words into a single sentence use `join_words` method.

For example, to join three words:

```ruby
Strings::Inflect.join_words("one", "two", "three")
# => "one, two, and three"
```

To join words without Oxford style comma use `:final_separator`:

```ruby
Strings::Inflect.join_words("one", "two", "three", final_separator: "")
# => "one, two and three"
```

To join words with custom separators:

```ruby
options = {
  separator: " or ",
  final_separator: " or at least ",
  conjunctive: ""
}
Strings::Inflect.join_words("one", "two", "three", **options)
# => "one or two or at least three"
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
